  - lib/features/auth/view/auth_form.dart (improved responsiveness)
  - lib/features/auth/view/auth_page.dart (added keyboard handling)
  - lib/shared/widgets/neo_text_field.dart (made responsive)
  - lib/shared/widgets/neo_button.dart (made responsive)
- 📝 Lessons learned:
  1. ALWAYS test UI on ALL target platforms (Android, iOS, web) before committing
  2. iOS keyboard behavior is different from Android and requires special handling
  3. Use MediaQuery.viewInsets.bottom to detect keyboard height
  4. Always implement scrolling in forms to handle keyboard appearance
  5. Test with the smallest supported screen size with keyboard open
  6. Document platform-specific issues and solutions in detail
  7. Never assume a UI that works on one platform will work on all platforms

## [2023-04-22 | 19:30 PM]
- ❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Flutter binding not initialized before accessing platform services
- ❌ Issue: Attempted to initialize Hive without calling WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()
- ❌ Issue: Received error: "Binding has not yet been initialized" when running the app
- ❌ Issue: Platform services (file system, etc.) were not available for Hive to use
- ✅ Fixed by adding WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized() call in bootstrap.dart
- 🔄 Solution implemented:
  1. Added WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized() call before any platform service access
  2. Ensured this call happens before Hive initialization
- 📁 Files changed:
  - lib/bootstrap.dart (added binding initialization)
- 📝 Lessons learned:
  1. ALWAYS call WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized() in main() before accessing any platform services
  2. This is especially important for plugins that access file system, camera, etc.
  3. The binding connects Dart code to the underlying platform services
  4. This is a fundamental requirement for Flutter plugins and should never be overlooked
  5. The error message "Binding has not yet been initialized" is a clear indicator of this issue

## [2023-04-22 | 20:00 PM]

- ❌ Issue: Error message: "The same instance of an HiveObject cannot be stored with two different keys"
- ❌ Issue: Attempting to store the same UserModel instance with both email and 'current_user' keys
- ✅ Fixed by creating a copy of the user object before storing as current user
- 🔄 Solution implemented:
  1. Modified loginUser method in AuthRepository to create a new UserModel instance
  2. Used the copy for the 'current_user' key while keeping the original for the email key
- 📁 Files changed:
  - lib/features/auth/repository/auth_repository.dart (fixed Hive storage issue)
- 📝 Lessons learned:
  1. Hive objects cannot be stored with multiple keys in the same box
  2. Always create copies of objects when storing with different keys

  - Multiple files (fixed import ordering)
- 📝 Lessons learned:
  1. ALWAYS test code before committing, even if it seems correct
  2. Check package documentation thoroughly before using components
  3. Use placeholder files with proper TODOs for features to be implemented later
  4. Run flutter analyze regularly to catch issues early

  2. iOS keyboard behavior is different from Android and requires special handling
  3. Use MediaQuery.viewInsets.bottom to detect keyboard height
  4. Always implement scrolling in forms to handle keyboard appearance
  5. Test with the smallest supported screen size with keyboard open
  6. Document platform-specific issues and solutions in detail
  7. Never assume a UI that works on one platform will work on all platforms

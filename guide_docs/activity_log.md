- ✅ Created AuthCubit with proper state management (initial, loading, success, failure)
- ✅ Implemented form validation using Formz
- ✅ Created custom NeoTextField and NeoButton widgets
- ❌ Issue: Email regex pattern caused compilation errors due to single quote in the pattern

  - lib/app/view/app.dart (updated to use AuthPage)
- 🧪 Tests added: test/features/auth/cubit/auth_cubit_test.dart with 10 test cases
- 📝 Lessons learned:
  1. Be careful with regex patterns, especially with special characters
  2. Use Formz for form validation to simplify state management
  3. Break down UI components into smaller, reusable widgets

## [2023-04-22 | 16:00 PM]
- ❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Committed code without testing it first
- ❌ Issue 1: NeoPopTextField and NeoPopButton components don't exist in the neopop package
- ❌ Issue 2: Barrel files for unimplemented features caused compilation errors
- ❌ Issue 3: Import directives were not sorted alphabetically

  - lib/features/{donation,flowchart,video_feed,winner}/*.dart (added TODOs)
  - Multiple files (fixed import ordering)
- 📝 Lessons learned:
  1. ALWAYS test code before committing, even if it seems correct
  2. Check package documentation thoroughly before using components
  3. Use placeholder files with proper TODOs for features to be implemented later
  4. Run flutter analyze regularly to catch issues early
  5. Document platform-specific setup requirements in dev_rules.md

## [2023-04-22 | 16:15 PM]

## [2023-04-22 | 16:30 PM]
- ❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Failed to test on iOS simulator where keyboard caused severe overflow issues
- ❌ Issue: Auth UI had overflow issues specifically when keyboard appeared on iOS devices
- ❌ Issue: Form elements were pushed off-screen and became inaccessible when typing
- ❌ Issue: No scrolling was implemented to handle keyboard appearance
- ❌ Issue: Responsiveness was not properly tested on different screen sizes
- ✅ Improved responsiveness of Auth UI components
- ✅ Added keyboard handling to prevent overflow issues
- ✅ Made UI elements adapt to different screen sizes
- 🔄 Solutions implemented:
  1. Used SingleChildScrollView to allow scrolling when keyboard appears on iOS
  2. Added conditional rendering to hide header when keyboard is visible
  3. Made text fields and buttons responsive based on screen width
  4. Added GestureDetector to dismiss keyboard when tapping outside inputs
  5. Used SafeArea to handle system UI elements like notches
  6. Implemented proper constraints to prevent overflow on smaller screens
- 📁 Files changed:
  - lib/features/auth/view/auth_form.dart (improved responsiveness)
  - lib/features/auth/view/auth_page.dart (added keyboard handling)
  - lib/shared/widgets/neo_text_field.dart (made responsive)
  - lib/shared/widgets/neo_button.dart (made responsive)
- 📝 Lessons learned:
  1. ALWAYS test UI on ALL target platforms (Android, iOS, web) before committing
  2. iOS keyboard behavior is different from Android and requires special handling
  3. Use MediaQuery.viewInsets.bottom to detect keyboard height
  4. Always implement scrolling in forms to handle keyboard appearance
  5. Test with the smallest supported screen size with keyboard open
  6. Document platform-specific issues and solutions in detail
  7. Never assume a UI that works on one platform will work on all platforms

## [2023-04-22 | 17:00 PM]

## [2023-04-22 | 19:30 PM]
- ❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Flutter binding not initialized before accessing platform services
- ❌ Issue: Attempted to initialize Hive without calling WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()
- ❌ Issue: Received error: "Binding has not yet been initialized" when running the app
- ❌ Issue: Platform services (file system, etc.) were not available for Hive to use
- ✅ Fixed by adding WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized() call in bootstrap.dart

  3. The binding connects Dart code to the underlying platform services
  4. This is a fundamental requirement for Flutter plugins and should never be overlooked
  5. The error message "Binding has not yet been initialized" is a clear indicator of this issue

## [2023-04-22 | 20:00 PM]

- ❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Home page stuck in loading state after sign-up
- ❌ Issue: User was not set as current user during sign-up process
- ❌ Issue: Home page couldn't find current user data after sign-up
- ✅ Fixed by updating registerUser method to set the user as current user

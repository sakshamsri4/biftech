## [2023-04-22 | 14:55 PM]
- ✅ Implemented Step 1: Created feature module directories
- ✅ Set up folder structure for auth, video_feed, flowchart, donation, and winner modules
- ✅ Added barrel files for easier imports
- ✅ Created shared directory for common widgets and models
- 📁 Files created:
  - lib/features/{auth,video_feed,flowchart,donation,winner}/{view,cubit,model}/

## [2023-04-22 | 15:00 PM]
- ❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Made changes directly on main branch, violating Git workflow rules
- 🔄 Created feature branch `feature/setup` and moved changes there
- 📁 Files changed: None (branch operation only)
- 📝 Lessons learned:
  1. Always create a feature branch before starting any work
  2. Follow Git workflow rules specified in dev_rules.md
  3. Double-check branch status before making any changes
  4. Add branch creation step explicitly in roadmap documentation
